      <description>Preamble In Section 14.3 of my (2020a) translation of the first edition of McElreath’s (2015) Statistical rethinking, I included a bonus section covering Bayesian meta-analysis. For my (2020b) translation of the second edition of the text (McElreath, 2020), I’d like to include another section on the topic, but from a different perspective. The first time around, we focused on standardized mean differences. This time, I’d like to tackle odds ratios and, while we’re at it, give a little bit of a plug for open science practices.</description>

      <description>[edited Feb 27, 2019]
Preamble I released the first bookdown version of my Statistical Rethinking with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse project a couple weeks ago. I consider it the 0.9.0 version. I wanted a little time to step back from the project before giving it a final edit for the first major edition. I also wanted to give others a little time to take a look and suggest edits, which some thankfully have.</description>
