      <description>Version 1.0.0  tl;dr When researchers decide on a sample size for an upcoming project, there are more things to consider than null-hypothesis-oriented power. Bayesian researchers might like to frame their concerns in terms of precision. Stick around to learn what and how.
 Are Bayesians doomed to refer to \(H_0\) 1 with sample-size planning? If you read my last post, you may have found yourself thinking: Sure, last time you avoided computing \(p\)-values with your 95% Bayesian credible intervals.</description>

      <description>Version 1.0.0  tl;dr If you’d like to learn how to do Bayesian power calculations using brms, stick around for this multi-part blog series. Here with part I, we’ll set the foundation.
 Power is hard, especially for Bayesians. Many journals, funding agencies, and dissertation committees require power calculations for your primary analyses. Frequentists have a variety of tools available to perform these calculations (e.g., here). Bayesians, however, have a more difficult time of it.</description>
