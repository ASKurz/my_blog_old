      <description>Hit the pause I started this series intending to add semiregular installments. Perhaps I’d add one every other month or so. It turns out I’m just not up to it, right now.
Someone important to me died during this plague. Reading and blogging on this book was and has been a way to connect with them—to honor their life. The experience has been rich and raw and meaningful. I hope that not too far off in the future, I’ll be in a better place to take up this task.</description>

      <description>I’ve been reading David France’s How to Survive a Plague: The Inside Story of How Citizens and Science Tamed AIDS. It’s a masterwork. And it’s devastating. Two months in and I haven’t cracked 100 pages. HSP is the kind of book I can only take 10—20 pages at a time. But like anything soulful and hard and true, it’s worth it.
For example, what do you know about the first baby on record to have died of AIDS?</description>
