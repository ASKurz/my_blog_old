      <description>A colleague reached out to me earlier this week with a plotting question. They had fit a series of Bayesian models, all containing a common parameter of interest. They knew how to plot their focal parameter one model at a time, but were stumped on how to combine the plots across models into a seamless whole. It reminded me a bit of this gif
which I originally got from Jenny Bryan’s great talk, Behind every great plot there’s a great deal of wrangling.</description>
