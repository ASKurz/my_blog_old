      <description>In this post, we’ll show how Student’s \(t\)-distribution can produce better correlation estimates when you data have outliers. As is often the case, we’ll do so as Bayesians.
This post is a direct consequence of Adrian Baez-Ortega’s great blog, “Bayesian robust correlation with Stan in R (and why you should use Bayesian methods)”. Baez-Ortega worked out the approach and code for use with Stan, directly. Since I’m a fan of the brms package, it seemed only right that we might extend Baez-Ortega’s method to brms.</description>

      <description>[edited Feb 3, 2018]
The purpose of this post is to demonstrate the advantages of the Student’s \(t\)-distribution for regression with outliers, particularly within a Bayesian framework.
I make assumptions I’m presuming you are familiar with linear regression, familiar with the basic differences between frequentist and Bayesian approaches to fitting regression models, and have a sense that the issue of outlier values is a pickle worth contending with. All code in is R, with a heavy use of the tidyverse–which you might learn a lot about here, especially chapter 5– and Paul Bürkner’s brms package.</description>
