Iâ€™m not actively teaching, at the moment. But during my graduate training at the University of Mississippi, I taught five semesters of Psy 201, *General Psychology*. In addition, I taught five semesters of Psy 405, *Meditation in Daily Life*. And in my final semester on campus at the University of Mississippi, I also offered a semester-long graduate-level workshop, *Introduction to Applied Bayesian Data Analysis Using R*.
