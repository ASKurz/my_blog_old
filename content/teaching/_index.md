I am not teaching any courses, at the moment. During my graduate training at the University of Mississippi, I taught five semesters of *General Psychology* (Psy 201) and five semesters of *Meditation in Daily Life* (Psy 405). In my final year on campus at the University of Mississippi, I also offered a semester-long graduate-level workshop, *Introduction to Applied Bayesian Data Analysis Using R*. Nowadays I offer private statistics consultations and periodically chime on Bayesian statistics in the [brms section of the Stan forums](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/c/interfaces/brms/36).
