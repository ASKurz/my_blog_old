I am not actively teaching, at the moment. During my graduate training at the University of Mississippi, I taught five semesters of Psy 201, *General Psychology*, and five semesters of Psy 405, *Meditation in Daily Life*. In my final semester on campus at the University of Mississippi, I also offered a semester-long graduate-level workshop, *Introduction to Applied Bayesian Data Analysis Using R*. Nowadays I occasionally chime on statistics in the [brms section of the Stan forums]( https://discourse.mc-stan.org/c/interfaces/brms/36).
