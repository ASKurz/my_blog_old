Spurred by a recent article by [Chivers (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02041-5), there are some nice discussions of conflicts of interest going on among psychologists at the moment (e.g., [here](https://twitter.com/StuartJRitchie/status/1146113067375353856), [here](https://twitter.com/IoanaA_Cristea/status/1146441218810925057), [here](https://twitter.com/hardsci/status/1146115810940739585)). To that end:

## I have been paid for my work.

I am currently employed as a Clinical Research Psychologist within the [VISN 17 Center of Excellence for Research on Returning War Veterans](https://www.mirecc.va.gov/visn17/) (CoE), which is a unified scientific and educational center of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. During my two-year postdoctoral fellowship at the CoE (2018--2020), I was funded by the [Office of Academic Affiliations](https://www.va.gov/oaa/specialfellows/programs/SF_HSRD.asp?p=5). During that time, I worked on projects with [Eric C. Meyer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i99DmhQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), who had received funding as both a PI and co-investigator in numerous projects relevant to the well-being of US war veterans (see [here](https://www.bswhealth.med/research/Documents/warriors-research-institute/cv-meyer-e.pdf)).
